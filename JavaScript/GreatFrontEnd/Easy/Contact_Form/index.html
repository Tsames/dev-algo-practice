<!-- Building forms is a common task in Front End. In this exercise, we will build a basic "Contact Us" form, commonly seen
on marketing websites for visitors to ask questions or provide feedback.

Requirements - The form should contain the following elements:
  Name field
  Email field
  Message field. Since the message can be long, using a <textarea> will be more suitable.
  Submit button
    Contains the text "Send".
    Clicking on the submit button submits the form.

The form and submission should be implemented entirely in HTML. No JavaScript should be used for this question.
There is no need to do any client-side validation on the fields. Validation will be done on the server side. -->
