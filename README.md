# Tom Ames - Dev Practice

This repository is intended to document my daily code exercises and development of skill with new technologies.

I've organized this repo into two main sub folders for each major language that I know. Under each of the language folders you'll find challenges from LeetCode and GreatFrontEnd, instruction and exercises from AlgoMonster or other resources, and recreation of common Data Structures and Algorithms.

I have tried to include instructions as comments for most exercises as well as associated test scripts.
