# Tom Ames - Dev Practice

This repository is intended to document daily code exercises. It consists of Challenges from Leetcode.com, GreatFrontEnd, AlgoMonster, and some recreation of common Data Structures and Algorithms. Both the LeetCode and GreatFrontEnd challenges are organized by difficulty. In each script I try to include the challenge directions, and some sample tests with the expected output.
