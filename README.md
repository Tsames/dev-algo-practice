# Tom Ames - Dev Practice

This repository is intended to document daily code exercises. It consists of Kata challenges from CodeWars.com, Challenges from Leetcode.com, and other miscellaneous exercises. Both the LeetCode and CodeWars challenges are organized by difficulty. In each script I try to include the challenge directions, and some sample tests with the expected output.
